## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document provides a detailed specification for the Cow Management System, which is designed to streamline the management of cows, their health, milk production, feeding, breeding, and related farm operations.

### 1.2 Scope
The Cow Management System is a web-based application that enables farm owners and managers to track cow-related data, manage milk production records, monitor health, feeding, berth assignments, and generate reports. The system will provide user authentication and role-based access to ensure secure data management.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- CMS: Cow Management System
- UI: User Interface
- DB: Database

### 1.4 References
- [Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/)
- [Spring Framework Documentation](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
- [React Documentation](https://react.dev/)

### 1.5 Overview
This SRS describes the functional and non-functional requirements, system features, and external interfaces for the Cow Management System.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The Cow Management System will serve as a centralized solution for managing farm operations related to cows. It is intended to replace manual record-keeping with a digital, efficient, and user-friendly platform.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- Register and manage cow profiles, including berth assignment and feed information
- Track milk production per cow
- Manage and track feeding schedules and nutrition plans
- Monitor cow health (vaccinations, illnesses, treatments)
- Track breeding and reproduction cycles
- Generate analytical and summary reports
- Role-based user management
- Send notifications for important events

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Farm Owner:** Full access to all system features
- **Manager:** Access to cow data, reports, and health logs
- **Worker:** Limited access for data entry
- **Veterinarian:** Access to health logs and treatments
- **Nutritionist:** Access to feed and nutrition data

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- Web application compatible with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Backend: Java (Spring Boot)
- Frontend: JavaScript (React), HTML, CSS
- Database: MySQL or similar RDBMS

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- Must use Java and JavaScript as primary languages
- Data privacy and security must be maintained
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

### 2.6 User Documentation
- User manual (to be provided)
- Online help and support

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have basic computer literacy
- Reliable internet access required
- Backend server and database hosted securely

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 Cow Registration and Management
- Add, edit, delete cow profiles (ID, breed, date of birth, owner, gender, ear tag, pedigree, etc.)
- Assign cows to groups or locations (berth/stall)
- Record cow status (active, retired, sold, deceased)

### 3.2 Berth/Location Management
- Manage and assign berths/stalls to cows
- Track berth occupancy and cleaning schedules
- Record movements between berths or pastures

### 3.3 Milk Production Tracking
- Record daily/periodic milk yield per cow
- Link milk production to feeding, health, and breeding data
- Analyze production trends and performance

### 3.4 Feed and Nutrition Management
- Define feed types and nutrition plans
- Track daily feed intake per cow or group
- Schedule and log feeding times and quantities
- Monitor feed inventory and generate alerts for low stock
- Link nutrition plans to milk yield and health records

### 3.5 Health Monitoring
- Log vaccinations, illnesses, treatments, and medications
- Track scheduled health checks and appointments
- Record weight, temperature, and other vital statistics

### 3.6 Breeding and Reproduction Tracking
- Log breeding events, insemination, and pregnancy status
- Record calving dates, calf data, and genealogy
- Monitor reproductive cycles and manage breeding schedules

### 3.7 Reporting and Analytics
- Generate reports: milk production, health status, feed efficiency, berth occupancy, breeding performance, cow inventory
- Export data (PDF/CSV)
- Dashboard for key performance indicators (KPIs)

### 3.8 User Management & Authentication
- Register, edit, delete users
- Role-based access control
- Secure login/logout

### 3.9 Notification System
- Alerts for health events, low milk yield, scheduled feeding/checkups, berth maintenance, breeding events, and feed inventory

---

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces
- Responsive web UI for all user roles
- Forms for data entry and management
- Dashboards and reports
- Calendar view for feeding, health, and breeding schedules

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces
- Standard PC, tablet, or mobile device

### 4.3 Software Interfaces
- RESTful API endpoints
- Database connectivity (JDBC)

### 4.4 Communication Interfaces
- Email notifications (SMTP)
- Possible SMS integration for alerts

---

## 5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements
- Fast response time (<2 seconds for typical actions)
- Support for simultaneous users

### 5.2 Safety Requirements
- Data backup and recovery procedures

### 5.3 Security Requirements
- Encrypted password storage
- Secure communication (HTTPS)
- Prevent unauthorized data access

### 5.4 Software Quality Attributes
- Usability: Intuitive UI
- Reliability: Fault tolerance, error handling
- Maintainability: Modular code structure
- Scalability: Support increasing data and users

### 5.5 Business Rules
- Only authorized users can modify or delete cow or health records
- Milk yield records must be immutable after submission
- Feed logs must be accurate and updated daily
- Berth assignments must not exceed capacity
